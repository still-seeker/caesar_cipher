Code in this repo is about practice methods in ruby just to get more familiar  
It includes: cipher(which shifts characters in a string by a given factor)  
-->substrings(this runs a dictionary check of all substrings of a string in a dictionary array)
and returns a hash containing words and count  
-->stock_picker(chooses best days to buy and sell stocks) from an array of stock prices per days
and returns an array of two best days to buy and sell according to profit margin  
-->bubble_sort(swaps every two elements in ascending order) and returns a sorted array
